Hackathon 2


Project ManoMano

Hello everyone!
We are the Sunday Bricodeurs. 

ManoMano ask us for find the solutions to improve your user experience.

My Team propose you two solutions:

Le first challengue was the menu. It was hard to read with a lot of text. We are a solution: more images for this menu.

Another proposition is a beautiful garden to show the products for the gardening and you can click to buy thim.

The second idea is to add a link to the products notice for have all details you need to buy, a link to the tutorial vid√©os to install your product and finally a link to have some proffesionals to help you. You can see that in this repo.

Here you can see the demo https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1opFsv0rHLIda3EUDIsltnmusJNIhR_pcwq7UpQFpNF4/edit#slide=id.g1091f23b94f_0_54.

Thank you to Wild Code School and ManoMano for this challenge.
